Freeflow Learning: Empowering Free Education

This project, created by our team, is a full-fledged website named Freeflow Learning that generates free courses tailored to your specific needs and interests.

Core Objective:

1) Provide users with personalized access to free online courses based on their individual queries and requests.
2) Create a central platform where all learning resources related to a particular topic are easily discoverable.


User Experience:

1) Login: Start by clicking the "Login" button to authenticate yourself using your Google account. Google Firebase securely handles the      backend login process.
2) Course Search: Upon successful login, the homepage presents a search bar where you can type any course you're interested in. Relevant links to those courses will be dynamically generated and displayed.
3) Course Cards: Generated links are conveniently presented as cards for optimal readability and easy browsing.
4) Logout: Once finished, you can seamlessly log out from the website with a two-step verification process confirming your exit.

Tech Stack:

1) Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript & TSX) with Tailwind CSS
2) Backend: Google Firebase (User Login)
3) Course Link Generation: Gemini API (powered by Google)



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
