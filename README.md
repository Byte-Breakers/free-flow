We, as a team have come up with a solution where a website will generate free courses to the user based on his query/request.
The Website "Freeflow Learning" is designed with the above objective.
It also ensures that the all resources pertained to a topic will be under one common platform.
It initially begins when a user is prompted to login by clicking the Login button. The Google Firebase will ensure the back-end part related to login where the user will be logged in to his/her google account.
Once when the home page occurs, a search bar occurs where user can type any course which he wants and the links will be generated.
Once done, the user can also logout from the website. It involves a two-step verification and the user is logged out Successfully.
The Tech Stack involved are:
Frontend : Next js(Typescript tsx) with Tailwind CSS
Backend : Google Firebase(For user login)
Links are generated by Gemini API which is powered by Google.
Links are displayed in the form of cards for better readability.

Basic requirements:
Once when all the required project dependencies such as next,firebase and tailwind are installed,
run "npm run dev" in the command line and localhost:3000  will load the website appropriately.

Happy coding!
